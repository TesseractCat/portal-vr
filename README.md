# Portal VR

Portal clone in VR. Features a level editor.

Sadly, I was unable to get this working on VR headsets other than the Lenovo Explorer. Unity still has issues with multi-headset support.

If you have another headset and can get it running, please submit a PR :).

## What works

- Level editor
- Portals
- Level selector
- Some common level components

## What needs work

- More level components
- UI/UX needs improvement
- Grabbing objects is buggy
- Portal physics is buggy
- Performance needs work
